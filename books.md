"The poets whose work is brought together in <i>AUP New Poets 8</i> all write with an intoxicating sense of the world’s beauty, its depth and distances. All three poets are concerned with memory and its traces, with artistry and the forms it can take, with the natural world at its most infinitesimal and at its most vast.

I have loved travelling through the worlds evoked in these poems, some so familiar, some so remote, all so alluring."

— from the foreword by Anna Jackson

"The first section is from prolific writer and editor Lily Holloway. Holloway has been a force in Aotearoa poetry in the last couple of years, publishing widely and co-founding Aotearoa’s first queer poetry journal, eel magazine (the first issue has just been released—worth noting here for its depth and breadth). Holloway’s section in this book, ‘a child in the alcove’, gives us insight into the little things that move them: Velma and the mystery machine, Sistema lunch boxes, starfish and crustaceans. These little pockets of refuge amidst a storm of heavy subject matter provide a deft balance of the light and the heavy. 

In their early twenties, Holloway writes like someone beyond their years. A lot of the work inspects and reflects on temporality, on what it means to rewind or return or repeat."

Holloway's "selection, 'a child in that alcove,' really showcases her versatility and ambition as a writer, with really thorny, evocative lines and images that stay with you."

"Lily tackles the extraordinary in the everyday and really emphasises the passing of time and how that can have an effect on how we reconcile events in our personal pasts, and the loops that we can get stuck in."

Holloway's "aural and linguistic deftness, the sweet measure of surprise, the variegated forms, the connecting undercurrents, the honey, the bitterness. Her poems run on the rewarding premise that poems don’t need the full explanation, that tactile detail and deft juxtapositions can unmask love, desire, razor edges, self-exposure. Pocket narratives are equally sublime."

"Three poets, three distinctive voices sampling on a wide – perhaps endless – continuum of topoi and technique. After all, ‘There is no end to possible meanings’ (from Holloway’s *Is any of this relevant?* pp. 17–19)."

Holloway's "voice is mature and contemplative, her collection 'a child in that alcove' contains some beautiful compositions of the English language."

"Holloway brings moments from her daily life and expresses them to her readers. Her poetry is filled with excitement, with dread, with questions and with memories of people from her life. [...] Her writing touched my soul and left me with joy but also a missing tooth."

<br>

Holloway "uses a variety of styles: erasures, tabular material, wide variation in spacing. Each poem stands separate, using visual and verbal effects to make her points, but the variation itself holds the individual pieces together."
