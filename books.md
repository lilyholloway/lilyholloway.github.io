"The poets whose work is brought together in <i>AUP New Poets 8</i> all write with an intoxicating sense of the world’s beauty, its depth and distances. All three poets are concerned with memory and its traces, with artistry and the forms it can take, with the natural world at its most infinitesimal and at its most vast.

I have loved travelling through the worlds evoked in these poems, some so familiar, some so remote, all so alluring."

— from the foreword by Anna Jackson

Holloway's "aural and linguistic deftness, the sweet measure of surprise, the variegated forms, the connecting undercurrents, the honey, the bitterness. Her poems run on the rewarding premise that poems don’t need the full explanation, that tactile detail and deft juxtapositions can unmask love, desire, razor edges, self-exposure. Pocket narratives are equally sublime."

"Three poets, three distinctive voices sampling on a wide – perhaps endless – continuum of topoi and technique. After all, ‘There is no end to possible meanings’ (from Holloway’s *Is any of this relevant?* pp. 17–19)."

Holloway's "voice is mature and contemplative, her collection 'a child in that alcove' contains some beautiful compositions of the English language."

"Holloway brings moments from her daily life and expresses them to her readers. Her poetry is filled with excitement, with dread, with questions and with memories of people from her life. [...] Her writing touched my soul and left me with joy but also a missing tooth."
