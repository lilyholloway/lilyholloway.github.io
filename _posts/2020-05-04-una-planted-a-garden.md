<div class="row">
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#aaa;">
    <p>hide under tables
clutch matriarch calves
within temple of vine and moss

fossilised maze witches
catch pond frogs
kererū coo

not hushed
she would have laughed
shakes of soft mulch

on mānuka kānuka kauri
on berloddy Tāne Mahuta!
threads of sunlight descend

pre-burial in purple
rotted bench planks
weeds colonising
</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#bbb;">
    <p>pīwakawaka flirt
lilting bough to bough
hop semiquavers

wink of tail is an eyelash flutter
eyes glinting over a mother’s shoulder
Puck of the bush

opportunistic
glimpses
peeking cloud

catch her trap crepuscular
snatch insect wings
silhouetted insomniac dawn

swooping seeking
bugs
stirred up by our shoes
</p>
  </div>
</div>

<em>Judges’ comments: </em>
><em>&ldquo;</em>una planted a garden <em>[...] dances in its evocation of a rich, fertile, bursting space that brims with life. The experimentation with form immediately intrigued me, with squat mirroring stanzas, almost like a call and response, reflecting the choric notes of the birds flitting throughout. This was an accomplished, primal, vital, buzzing poem that I thoroughly enjoyed."</em>
