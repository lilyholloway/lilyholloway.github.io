<em>Judgesâ€™ comments: </em>
><em>&ldquo;</em>una planted a garden <em>[...] dances in its evocation of a rich, fertile, bursting space that brims with life. The experimentation with form immediately intrigued me, with squat mirroring stanzas, almost like a call and response, reflecting the choric notes of the birds flitting throughout. This was an accomplished, primal, vital, buzzing poem that I thoroughly enjoyed."</em>
