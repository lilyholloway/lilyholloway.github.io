i) clotho

 

pulled out of thumb endless i am

knuckleward and they call me a wheel

i am they call me a wheel you pull

across cheekbones to feel         what        type          of             plait

i am          spinning tightness tightness and they drag me

dough between spread fingers i feel them call me a wheel

see the pith of the orange stretching between i’m

gelatine melting into strings i want to be ripped apart

sleekness beneath my belly                they call me a wheel thinning

 

they call me a wheel                           churning tarmac rolling mossy

earthquakes slips and landslides

 

they call me a bobbin they call me spin cycle

 

they call me a wheel                           spinning in the parlour

sat in front of fire       only weaving              only weaving             

i am a narrator    not listened at the door not

about my day              they call me a tapestry taught down

dry                   they call me a tapestry but they have not asked me

  

behind curtains and the moths have been       sucking              me

 

weaving snakes between columns                   they call me a tapestry

 

dripping silkiness on the welcome mat             they call me a tapestry

 

they call me a tapestry                        they call me a tapestry torn

 

they call me a tapestry                        hanging in the hallway

iii) atropos

 

above              the                    fire

all the trinkets are stuffed i am a sword on the wall

seas let’s drown in depths we have not                       seen

                       and                  they call me a sword jumping

 

fly in windless nights leaf

ing hands        so         loose              they                 rip and rib

 

on the roof i say they call me a sword stretch

out       pull       me      out vibrating i want    out so get me out i’m pounding

 

pavement rhythms into skulls            they call me a sword get          me

 

they call me a sword               they call me a sword pounding

 

they call me a sword               sheathed in gut lining

above    the                    fire

swerve

front

sweet

neck

can’t

cut

in

where

your

seams

meet

snip

those

thick

staples

and

let

drip

down
