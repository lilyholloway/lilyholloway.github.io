<p>i am worried things will never be okay</p>

<p>because i slept all day</p>

<p>i woke wondering why i could hear the sea and thought maybe</p>

<p>the very tops of the trees were moving in the wind</p>

<p>just the very tops</p>

<p>but it was your laptop overheating</p>

<p>&#8203;</p>

<p>in the night i pull a fragile train behind me</p>

<p>a blanket trailing in earth</p>

<p>not like how illegally released koi</p>

<p>are dragged over the rocks</p>

<p>because they are ornamental and inedible</p>

<p>on their way to be put into the meat grinder on the back of a flatbed truck</p>

<p>&#8203;</p>

<p>i dream i am scooby doo from the original 60s version</p>

<p>in the supermarket of the afterlife where everything is free</p>

<p>and each drink is exactly what you needed</p>

<p>but didn&rsquo;t know you needed</p>

<p>where you shoot rusted clockwork birds moving on rails around the castle walls</p>

<p>only to have them pop up again</p>

<p>&#8203;</p>

<p>a toaster is passed over my head and i tell my sister</p>

<p>to make her own ekphrastic postcards</p>

<p>and that koi skulls are sensitive to vibrations</p>

<p>they feel fingertips or bootlaces falling into the river</p>

<p>and flee in an orange rushing that you have to see to believe</p>

<p>like fanta</p><br>
