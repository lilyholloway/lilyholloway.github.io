<p>those fish in the stream by the coastlands laundromat</p>

<p>are sleek bodies swept grass-like</p>

<p>they run under the subway in the mall</p>

<p>flicker sunwards</p>

<p>
billboards with the flesh pushed or</p>

<p>out-slotted roadside onlook</p>

<p>a market in the paddock two months ago</p>

<p>politicians under bracken</p>

<p>cows huddled in a mass of five</p>

<p>
there&rsquo;s a goldfinch perched on the thistle</p>

<p>raspberry and slinking grass pressing</p>

<p>up against the paddock fence</p>

<p>and it bulges</p>

<p></p>

<p>and in the shed over the fence</p>

<p>jointed grass knocks out at the windows from the inside</p>

<p>splayed like fingers</p>

<p>knocking in nighttime wind</p>

<p>and it bulges</p>

<p>
wild hawkweed disembowels one of those green electric boxes</p>

<p>I had a dream that gorse was something different</p><br>
