when I get there as still life and landscape and also portraiture<br>

seeking the cacti in small pots who dot the globe<br>

slices of pie offer up the vision after the sermon<br>

expressing emotions without coherent narrative support<br>

because no artist responded to this call<br>

employing looser brushwork hitching up skirts and such<br>

their immediate successors leaving loose cutlery<br>

at the bottom of handbags of expanding lungs<br>

mimesis the technical keystone of forgetting slices of the years<br>

evergreens dancing waves follow arched trajectories of homemade bath bombs stadiums chanting god bless this temporal vector<br>

stylised lungs get wednesday standards<br>

and skirts construct trajectories<br><br>

trading in values I cut my hand on that sharp thing<br>

applied pressure embodied it in art wrapped it in a tablecloth<br>

opened it and released doves confetti a fresh breeze locusts flipping pages<br>

jumping puddles these kinds of things added up<br>

a ridiculed subculture standing in line at the supermarket<br>

between them the so-called modernist toddler marathon<br>

such illustrators also played badminton on wednesdays<br>

after folding the figures of doves ineluctable loose<br>

never creased before it was the final years of the july monarchy

not that they all lived in paris gumboots scuffing

a small dog walking herself noticed the characteristic sheen of such things

released the never expanding confetti gumboots

powerfully aware of the eyes of olympia dancing<br><br>

in manet’s wake fish heads peer above the water<br>

the flat shelf a mass of light and dark<br>

eclipsing profound ramifications on rounded edges folding<br>

clothing quite stylised figures of evergreens an almost magical<br>

degree of illusionism tripping on pavement cracks<br>

walking prints dark herself spilling sheen whispering into fish<br>

saluting the sun in unprecedented degrees of salinity<br>

book clubs spilling beetroot futile search for neutrality<br>

the combination of classicism and missing the bus<br>

strict standards of finish whisper sweet breathings<br>

japanese prints fall into ear holes while we sleep sideways

sleep cut between tablecloth and the hand on the pavement

constructing an imaginary end to expiration<br>
